          <p>George Doe is a student at Computer Science Faculty of UAIC. Due to spending too much time in front of the screen, he loves to do outdoor activities like hiking, swimming and paintball. Recently he tried reserved alongside his friends
            a match of air soft. Due to recommendation of the staff there, he installed the AiCo app and figured immediately how everything works. He was pleased to see that the app shows a preview of the filed and 
            more details about the main missions of the game. Also, when he entered on the voice channel his team created, he felt like in a real life battlefield.
          </p>

          <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
          <p>George uses the app alongside his teammates and gets assigned to a team. He analyze before the game details about the field he is playing on and missions assigned to the game.
            He enters details about the ammo got and checks the signal send on smartwatch app for when the game starts. After many kills and deaths, he sees that the time for current session is gone.
            Back to the waiting rom, he checks the score in the app and finds out that being good at CS:GO is not the same as being good at a real-life situation but determined to do a comeback he and his friends reserve another game next week.
